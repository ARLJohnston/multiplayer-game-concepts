Basic project to practice Gleam, Rust and Go

A basic 'game server' is implemented in Gleam, a 'client' in Rust and utils for testing etc in Go.
This moves a sprite, but both the server and the client have a view of it and can apply logic.

* Concepts
- Actors (Gleam)
- OTP (Gleam)
- Networking (Gleam, Rust, Go)
- Json Marshalling (Gleam, Rust, Go)
